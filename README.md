## üèÅ Running the app

This project was initialized with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), so make sure you've got the latest stable version of both [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) running locally.

For easier testing, you can just try out the latest deployed version by clicking [here](https://nttdata-challenge-client.vercel.app/). If you want to test it locally, keep reading:

First, clone this repository in your machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/lucaslafere/nttdata-challenge-client
```

Then, inside the cloned folder, run the following command to install the dependencies:

```
npm install
```

Then, create a .env file in the root folder, the same directory as the ".env.example" file. Use it to setup your API URL, which I provided in .env.example for the sake of easier testing.

When finished, just start the server, using the following command:

```
npm run start
```

:stop_sign: Don't forget to follow the steps mentioned above with the back-end [repository](https://github.com/lucaslafere/nttdata-challenge-server) if you want to run the API locally.
